            <h5>Mogalrajapuram <br> caves</h5>
            <p>The Mogalrajapuram Caves are a group of five rock-cut cave temples located in different parts of Vijayawada, Andhra Pradesh. They are dedicated to Shiva and date back to the 6th or 7th century CE. They are one of the oldest and most important archaeological sites in the region1

                The caves are known for their exquisite carvings and sculptures of Hindu deities, such as Ardhanarishvara, Nataraja, and Ganesha. The Ardhanarishvara statue is unique in South India and represents the fusion of Shiva and Parvati. The Nataraja statue depicts Shiva as the cosmic dancer, while the Ganesha statue shows the elephant-headed god of wisdom and success2
                
                The caves are also surrounded by lush greenery and offer a panoramic view of the city. They are a popular tourist attraction and a place of worship for many devotees. The caves are managed by the Archaeological Survey of India and have an entry fee of Rs. 3 per person23
